Everyday lots of food are wasted in private parties, hotels , restaurants etc. which is thrown away. There is also a need of food by many of people working in offices away from home and any other parties where there is a shortage of food etc. Our app aims to bridge the gap between the two.  
Payment will be made by the customers having food shortage.
The optimum price will be set by the Food Sellers which will be the cost for purchasing food for the customers.
